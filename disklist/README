AIX virtual disk inventory

These scripts analyze the disk configuration of IBM pSeries servers
and display the disks/luns and their relation in a web page.

There are two scripts:
- disklist_getdata.pl
  This script connects to the hosts/partitions HMC's and VIO's
  and writes the data found into a sqlite database file.
  It requires ssh access to all hosts involved.

- disklist_cgi.pl
  This cgi script analyzes the data found and display it on a series
  of web pages.

Prerequisites are perl (standard on AIX) and the DBI and DBD::Sqlite2
cpan modules.
